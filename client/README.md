# Minecraft Map Chat Client

The web client for the map. Use `npm run build` to build it.

## Development

Run `npm run dev` in one terminal to build the `index.ts` file, and run
`cd public && vite .` in another terminal to host the dev server.

You may need to put some generated tile files in ./public if you want to see the
map (remember to delete them before building the app).
